You can play the animation after uploading it using the "Upload Animation" button. After uploading, press "Play Frames" to start the animation.

Note: The animation speed slider may behave inconsistently. If you encounter any issues, move it slightly to correct the speed. An animation speed of around 60% is optimal for my animations.

on canvas:

Right-click = Move camera around dragon.

Mouse-wheel = Zoom in/out camera.
